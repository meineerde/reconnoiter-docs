    <para>
      Both <command>noitd</command> and <command>stratcond</command> make heavy
      use of SSL certificates. The SSL certificates are used for security 
      purposes, and are required for correct operation. The common names of the
      certs identify different system components to each other and must match 
      or the components will fail to communicate.
    </para>
    <para>
      It is strongly recommended that you use a certificate authority to manage
      the certificates issued to each <command>noitd</command> and 
      <command>stratcond</command> daemon.
