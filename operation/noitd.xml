  <title>Operating the noitd daemon</title>

<para>
Once <command>noitd</command> is configured and running, there
are several methods of interacting with the service.  The operator
can interactively manage the instance via the integrated command line
console (accessible via telnet on the port of your choice, as configured
in noitd.conf via listener elements; by default port 32322) and
programmatic access is available over the <command>noitd</command>
wire protocol on port 43191.
</para>

<para>
The wire protocol is a binary protocol that is leverage for
inter-system communication.  While not entirely compliant with
the HTTP specification, the protocol will give well formed HTTP
responses to sessions that commence with the terms: "DELETE"
"GET " "HEAD" "POST" "PUT ".
